# AVD Proof of Concept for Contoso

## Motivation
>*Guide a partner through an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Proof of Concept (PoC) by applying Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.*
 

## We want to help you:
- Asking the right questions at the right time.
- Give you sample templates (excel sheets, questionaires, images, code artefacts) and a home for them.
- Structure work so it can be done in a repetitive way + speed up deployments
- Meet customer expectations.

## How?
- We use the **Boards** to **track what work needs to be done** - when and by whom. We've already added some things to the 'list'.
- Make sure you understand the work item types and its proper usage. We don't assume to have a complete list - so please make it your own - do your CRUD ("Create read update delete") on them.
- The code **Repos**itory **already has some artefacts** (e.g. sample code, documentation, presentations,...) that can be used to speed up deployments. It is **also** the **place** where **you** should **store generated artefacts** throughout the project. 
- First you clone 'a baseline' from a public github repository and then you should consistently add your work files into this repository.
- We added some **Pipelines** to the project can be used to automate the Azure deployment e.g. of the landing zone parts (VNETs, subnets, VMs, images,...). They aligne with the user stories in the boards. 

## Annotations
**This guide is by all means not complete !**  
If you have any 'useful' ;-) contributions - let us know.  
It is a repository for you to learn, showcase, adopt, copy,...  
Technically **we target avd native** (not AVD citrix nor avd vmware horizon) - i.e. the samples and code artefacts are tailored for the microsofts release of AVD. However you might still reuse some parts for 'the other' i.e. avd citrix - AVD vmware.
  
Best regards,  
the Team.
